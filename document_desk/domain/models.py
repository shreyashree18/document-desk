"""
Domain entities.

These dataclasses represent the core business objects of the application,
independent of how they are persisted (SQLAlchemy) or transmitted over the
wire (Pydantic schemas in ``document_desk.domain.schemas``). Keeping them separate is
a Clean Architecture principle: the domain should not depend on
infrastructure or delivery-mechanism details.
